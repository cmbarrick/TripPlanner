# Phase 5 — AI Assistant

> Goal: Accelerate planning with an AI that **edits the real trip** (not just chats).
> Est: ~3 weeks · Depends on: Phase 3 (cloud infra for AI orchestration)

> **Status: ✅ Closed (2026-06-08).** Slices 0–4 shipped on **dev**: AI seam, preferences, ephemeral
> draft generation, SSE chat + tool-calling, batch undo, input guard + chat rate limit. Chat and
> Generate live on the **Assistant tab**; the trip planner **AI dock** remains a placeholder composer
> (undo-only after chat batches). Non-blocking validation hardening and the in-trip composer are
> **deferred** — see [`docs/phase-5-summary.md`](../../docs/phase-5-summary.md).

## Objectives
- Generate editable itineraries from a prompt.
- Provide a chat assistant that performs actions via tool-calling and respects preferences.

## Scope / tasks
- [x] **Slice 0 — AI seam:** `IAiProvider` + `DisabledAiProvider` / `FakeAiProvider` / `AzureOpenAiProvider`;
      API-side orchestration (App Service, not Edge Function); `AiPromptBuilder`; Postgres daily token quota;
      `GET /api/ai/status`; Assistant tab degrades gracefully when AI is off.
- [x] **Slice 1 — Preferences:** extend `Preference` (travel style, pace, diet, budget band);
      `GET/PUT /api/preferences`; Profile UI; `AiPromptBuilder.FormatUserPreferences` for prompt tail.
- [x] **Itinerary generation:** prompt → **ephemeral** draft preview via `POST /api/ai/trips/{id}/generate-itinerary`;
      user accepts → persisted as Tentative items via existing item CRUD.
- [x] **Chat assistant** with **tool-calling**: `searchPlaces`, `getWeather`,
      `addItineraryItem`, `moveItem`, `removeItem`, `suggestGapFill` via `POST /api/ai/trips/{id}/chat` (SSE).
- [x] **Real bookable activity options (2026-07-17):** `searchActivities` tool — real, currently-
      bookable tours/activities from `IActivityProvider` (Viator's Basic-Access affiliate API; no
      traffic-minimum gate, unlike GetYourGuide's partner program). The model can only ever
      *reference* an option by its `activityId`; it never sees or writes a booking URL/price
      itself — `addItineraryItem`'s optional `activityId` is re-resolved server-side via
      `IActivityProvider.GetDetailsAsync` before the item is saved, so a stale or invented id fails
      loud instead of silently attaching nothing (or something wrong). Same anti-fabrication
      discipline as Phase 6/8's citation validators, applied to tool-calling instead of RAG.
      `FakeActivityProvider` (dev/CI default) mirrors every other provider seam in this app.
- [x] **Preference-aware output:** stored preferences flow into generate-itinerary and chat prompts (Profile UI in Slice 1).
- [x] **Smart gap-fill:** `suggestGapFill` tool analyzes empty schedule slots (Slice 3).
- [x] **Streaming responses** in chat UI; trip-change activity rail with **batch undo** (Slice 4).
- [x] **Guardrails:** rate limiting, prompt-injection mitigation (quota in Slice 0).

## Design decisions (locked)
- **Orchestration:** ASP.NET API (reuses repo/providers/auth; SSE streaming). Azure Functions stay for async work (transcription).
- **LLM:** Azure OpenAI — mixed deployments (`DraftDeployment` = mini, `ChatDeployment` = 4o).
- **Quota store:** Postgres `ai_token_usage` table (per user / UTC day).
- **Drafts:** Ephemeral client-side preview until user accepts (not inserted as Tentative rows).
- **No fine-tuning:** JSON schema + tool validation + prompt evals.

## Out of scope
- Autonomous booking, payments (Later / v2).

## Testing plan
- [x] **Unit (Slice 0):** prompt builder, quota accounting, disabled/fake providers.
- [x] **Unit (Slice 1):** preferences validation, per-user isolation, prompt preference formatting.
- [x] **Unit (Slice 2):** draft JSON validation, generate endpoint, fake provider draft, quota on generate.
- [x] **Unit (Slice 3):** tool argument validation, tool execution, gap-fill, chat orchestration with fake provider.
- [x] **Unit (Slice 4):** undo batch application, input guard, undo steps from tool executor.
- [x] **Unit (real activity options):** `searchActivities` returns real (fake-in-dev) options
      without ever exposing a `bookingUrl` to the model; `addItineraryItem` with a valid
      `activityId` attaches the provider's real URL + prefills cost; an unknown `activityId`
      throws rather than silently adding the item with no link; omitting `activityId` entirely
      leaves `bookingUrl` null (existing behavior, unchanged).
- [ ] **Integration:** tool calls actually mutate the itinerary and persist; preferences flow
      into prompts; quota blocks when exceeded; provider wrapper is swappable (mocked).
- [ ] **AI evals (golden set):** a suite of prompts scored for: valid structure, respects
      constraints (dates/budget/diet), no hallucinated bookings, sensible geography/pacing.
      Run on every prompt or model change.
- [ ] **E2E:** "Plan 3 days in Lisbon, foodie, mid-budget" → draft appears & is editable →
      in chat "make day 2 more relaxed" → itinerary updates and persists → undo works.
- [ ] **Safety:** prompt-injection and unsafe-request test cases handled. *(Basic guard in Slice 4; expand eval set over time.)*
- [ ] **Regression:** Phases 0–3 suites green.

## Exit criteria
- [x] From a prompt, the AI produces an **editable** draft itinerary.
- [x] In chat, the AI can add/modify/reorder items that **persist**, with visible changes + undo.
- [x] Respects user preferences and stays within token quotas.
- [ ] AI eval suite passes the agreed quality thresholds. *(Deferred — golden eval suite not automated.)*

## Deferred / carried forward

| In-trip AI dock composer | Mockup in `option-4-map-ai-planner.html`; wire tap/type → chat for open trip → Phase 9 polish or pre–Phase 6 slice |
| Integration + E2E + golden evals | See testing plan below |
| Undo on Generate **Apply** | Chat tool batches only |
| Expanded safety evals | Basic `AiInputGuard` shipped |

## Progress log
- **2026-07-17** — **Real bookable activity options.** Considered GetYourGuide first — ruled out:
  every API tier requires existing traffic (100k+ monthly visits/50k downloads even for the
  cheapest "Teaser" tier; 1M+ traffic and 300 monthly bookings for the tier with actual
  availability data), so there's no path in pre-launch. Viator's Basic-Access affiliate API has no
  such gate — signup, get a key, done.
  New `Activities/` module (mirrors `Places/`): `IActivityProvider`/`ActivityOption`,
  `FakeActivityProvider` (dev/CI default, small hardcoded catalog), `ViatorActivityProvider` (real,
  config-selected when `Activities:ViatorApiKey` is set — same convention as every other provider
  seam). New `searchActivities` AI tool; `addItineraryItem` gained an optional `activityId` that
  the executor re-resolves server-side via `GetDetailsAsync` before ever writing a `BookingUrl` —
  the model can reference an id, it can never type a URL, price, or rating into existence. Search
  results shown to the model omit `bookingUrl` entirely (defense in depth: it literally can't
  hand-type a link it was never shown). `ChatAssistantRules` updated: must call `searchActivities`
  before recommending any bookable tour, must not claim a booking link exists unless a tool result
  confirmed it.
  **Verified against Viator's official Basic-Access Postman collection**
  (`docs.viator.com/partner-api/technical/Viator-Basic-Access-Affiliate-API-v2.postman_collection.json`,
  fetched directly since the interactive docs page was too large for automated fetching): base URL
  (`api.sandbox.viator.com/partner`), `exp-api-key` header, and `/products/{code}` GET all matched
  first-attempt assumptions; the `/search/freetext` POST body did not — `count` nests under
  `searchTypes[].pagination`, not flat, and a top-level `currency` is required — fixed to match
  once the real collection was in hand. Live-tested against the real sandbox with curl: the
  corrected request passes schema validation (a clean `401 Invalid API Key` from the auth layer,
  not a `400` body-validation error) — the sandbox key just hadn't finished Viator's own (up to
  24h) activation delay yet. **Response field names are still unverified** — the Postman
  collection documents requests, not example responses — so `ActivityOption`'s mapping
  (`pricing.summary.fromPrice`, `images[].url`, `reviews.combinedAverageRating`, `productUrl`)
  should be re-checked against a real response once the key activates; every field is
  nullable/optional specifically so a wrong guess degrades to a missing field, not a crash.
  **Tests: backend 240/240** (+9: 6 `AiToolExecutorTests`/`AiPlanningServiceTests` covering the
  full grounding guarantee, unaffected suites elsewhere unchanged).
- **Next:** once the Viator key activates, hand-verify a live `searchActivities` → `addItineraryItem`
  round trip end to end and correct any response field names that don't match; consider whether
  `/products/search` (destination-ID-based, supports date/price/rating filters) is worth the extra
  `/destinations` resolution step once Basic Access's freetext search proves too coarse.
